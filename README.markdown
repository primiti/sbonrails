# SBonRails

This is the source code for the Santa Barbara Rails Group website, [sbonrails.com](http://sbonrails.com).


## Getting up and running

### Requirements

sbonrails is built and managed primarily the following:

 * Ruby 1.8.x
 * Rubygems 1.3.5
 * Ruby on Rails 2.3.5
 * MySQL
 * git

### Gem Requirements
  * compass
  * haml
  * thoughtbot-shoulda
  * factory_girl
  * clearance
  * cucumber-rails
  * database_cleaner
  * webrat

### Initial setup

Before anything else, change into the newly created `sbonrails` directory.

    cd sbonrails

We need to make sure all the gem dependencies are installed:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test

Now we need to create an initial database. We currently assume you have MySQL installed, and that you can login as 'root' without a password.

    rake db:create

Next migrate the database to the latest version:

    rake db:migrate

Populate sample data

    rake db:seed_fu

At last, we can run the server:

    script/server

This will keep running until you hit Control-C, but now you can open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

## Testing

We are using shoulda & cucumber for our testing. Before running them, you need to run the following to create the test database:

    rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test

At this point, you can run them with:

    rake test

We are also using cucumber for user stories / integration testing. You can run them with:

    rake features
